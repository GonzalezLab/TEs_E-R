| FOLDER | INFO |
|------- | ---- | 
| significant_TEs_TEMP&TIDAL | #For finding those TEs detected by TEMP and TIDAL, comparing the TEs between pools and testing the significance of the increase/decresase in frequency |
| significant_TEs_TEMP | #For finding the TEs detected only by TEMP, comparing the TEs between pools and testing the significance of the increase/decresase in frequency |
| griffin_single_pool | #For detecting those TEs only present in a single control or selection pool in the Griffin study and test if the frequencies of the TEs only present in a single selection pool are significantly different from those only present in a single control pool |
| genomic_features | #For getting *D. melanogaster genomic* features |
| chromosome_features_TE_families_enrichment | #For testing the enrichment of different chromosomes, genomic features and different TE families |
| GO_enrichment | #For performing the GO enrichment analysis |
