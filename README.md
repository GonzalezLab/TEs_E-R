| FOLDER | INFO |
|------- | ---- | 
| 01.significant_TEs_TEMP-and-TIDAL | #For finding those TEs detected by TEMP and TIDAL, comparing the TEs between pools and testing the significance of the increase/decresase in frequency |
| 02.significant_TEs_TEMP | #For finding those TEs detected only by TEMP, comparing the TEs between pools and testing the significance of the increase/decresase in frequency |
| 03.griffin_single_pool | #For detecting those TEs only present in a single control or selection pool in the Griffin study and test if the frequencies of the TEs only present in a single selection pool are significantly different from those only present in a single control pool |
| 04.genomic_features | #For getting *D. melanogaster* genomic features |
| 05.chromosome_features_TE_families_enrichment | #For testing the enrichment of different chromosomes, genomic features and different TE families |
| 06.GO_enrichment | #For performing the GO enrichment analysis |
